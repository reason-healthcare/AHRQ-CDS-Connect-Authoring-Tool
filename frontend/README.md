# CDS Connect Authoring Tool

## About

The Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Authoring Tool is a web-based application aimed at simplifying the creation of production-ready CQL code. The project is based on "concept templates" (e.g. gender, HDL Cholesterol, etc.), which allow for additional clinical concepts to be included in the future. Concept modifiers are included to allow for more flexible definitions (e.g. most recent, value comparisons, etc.).

This version of the CDS Authoring Tool is developed by a community of HL7 stakeholders. The code was originally part of the [CDS Connect](https://cds.ahrq.gov/cdsconnect) project sponsored by the [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality](https://www.ahrq.gov/) (AHRQ), and initially developed under contract with AHRQ by MITRE's [Health FFRDC](https://www.mitre.org/our-impact/rd-centers/health-ffrdc).

## Development Details

This web frontend UI project is written in React. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Relevant files are in the `src/` filter. Refer to the Create React App [User Guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) for guidance on features and how to perform common tasks.

To develop this project you must install the version of Node referenced in [the Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) , which will also install npm. On macOS, for example, this can be done through (recommended) [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) (NVM), Homebrew (brew), or manually, such as:

```sh
brew install node # install node
```

Once installed, use npm to install the dependency libraries:

```
npm install # installs this app's dependencies based on this project's package.json / package-lock.json
```

To run the project, you'll also need to install and run the [CDS Authoring Tool API](../api).

### Add / Remove / Adjust dependencies

```bash
npm install <package> # add a package. add --save-dev if this is a development dependency.
npm install <package>@<version> # will adjust version
npm uninstall <package> # remove a package.
```

### Configuration

This project has very few configuration needs, most of which are configurable via environment variables:

- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: the URL for the backend API (defaults to `/authoring/api`)
- `REACT_APP_DAP_URL`: the URL for the DAP analytics endpoint (blank by default, indicating no analytics)
- `REACT_APP_GTM_KEY`: the Google Tag Manager key for analytics (blank by default, indicating no analytics)

The default values can be found in the `.env` file and overridden via environment variables. Note that during a production build, the current values in the environment and/or `.env` will be hard-coded into the resulting HTML and JS.

In addition, when running a production build via `server.js`, the [Content-Security-Policy](https://content-security-policy.com/) is active, requiring a [hash](https://content-security-policy.com/hash/) of the inline GoogleTagManager script in order for it to be invoked. Since the hash varies depending on the GTM key, it needs to be provided via an environment variable as well:

- `CSP_SCRIPT_HASH`: a hash that will be added to the `script-src` policy directive (e.g., `sha256-RFWPLDbv2BY+rCkDzsE+0fr8ylGr2R2faWMhq4lfEQc=`)

The easiest way to determine the required hash value is to do the following:

- Ensure `REACT_APP_GTM_KEY` is set via the `.env` file or environment variable
- Build the frontend and run it (`npm run start-prod`)
- Open the local Authoring Tool page in Google Chrome and look in the console for an error message with the hash

### Enabling HTTPS

By default, the frontend server and API server listen over unsecure HTTP. To listen over HTTPS, all three of the following environment variables must be set:

- `HTTPS`: Set to `true` to enable HTTPS.
- `SSL_KEY_FILE`: The absolute path to the SSL key file (e.g., `/data/ssl/server.key`)
- `SSL_CRT_FILE`: The absolute path to the SSL cert file (e.g., `/data/ssl/server.cert`)

These variable names match the variables documented in Create React App's [Using HTTPS in Development](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-https-in-development/) documentation.

### Run

**Development Mode** (with hot reload):
```bash
npm run dev # run the app in development mode with hot reload (webpack dev server)
# OR
npm start # same as npm run dev (React/CRA convention)
```

To easily run both the backend API server and the frontend in development mode, see the instructions on the main [README](../README.md).

### Production Build and Run

A production build compiles all of the files to standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can be run from any web server. It does require, however, that the path _/authoring/api_ be proxied to the API server.

**Build only:**
```bash
npm run build # does a production build, putting resulting files in ./build.
```

**Build and run production server:**
```bash
npm run start:prod # builds automatically, then runs the production server (requires API server to be running)
```

The production server uses Express to host the production code and proxy to the API server. The `start:prod` script automatically builds before starting (via npm's `prestart:prod` hook).

### Linting

JavaScript linting is done on the React components by ESLint, extending the rulesets from [react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-react-app), [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) _and_ [jsx-a11y](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) for accessibility checking. Please refer to those rulesets and use the [Airbnb JSX/React style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react).

Sass linting is done by Stylelint, using the [Stylelint standard config](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard).

```bash
npm run lint # runs eslint using the configuration in .eslintrc.
npm run lint:fix # runs eslint --fix using the configuration in .eslintrc. The --fix flag will autocorrect minor errors
npm run lint-css # runs stylelint 'src/styles/**/*.scss' using the configuration in .stylelintrc
```

### Testing

Frontend testing uses [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as the test runner. [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/index.html) provides helpers.

```bash
npm test # runs all frontend tests
npm test -- --coverage # view frontend test coverage
```

Jest provides the overall testing framework. The default setup running Jest via `npm test` will only run any tests that have been updated since the last commit. Use the prompt to specify running all tests or specific tests. Useful tools it provides are:

- [Setup and teardown](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/setup-teardown.html#content) methods
- [Matchers](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/expect.html) (assertions) to write statements expressing what a given value should be
- [Mock functions](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/mock-function-api.html#content) to test a component without having to include all needed functionality
- [Snapshot testing](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/snapshot-testing.html)

Enzyme is used for rendering and manipulating DOM elements. Shallow rendering will render a component without rendering any other components that are children, whereas full rendering will render a component with all its children components. Our rendered components can get and set state or props, find certain strings, classes, or tags, and simulate events.

- [Full rendering](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/mount.html) API reference
